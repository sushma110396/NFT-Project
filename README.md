#  NFT Marketplace 

This web application is a decentralized NFT marketplace that allows users to create their own NFT collection from images at an IPFS url and view their NFT collection. It also allows the user to buy NFTs using ETH/ERC20 tokens. The app is hosted on IPFS at https://cf-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafybeign6iwkwdkwdj2472fser7izm6c4sqblbw6mo3yfx3zpxvyzw7pda

Note: For part B: I have implemented the add on functionality where users can pay for NFTs using ERC20 tokens

### Prerequisites

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) Ethereum wallet provider.

To set up the repository, run the below
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sushma110396/NFT-Project.git
cd NFT-Project
npm install
```

Create a new .env file in the root of your project, which is right inside the NFT-Project folder, and add:
1)The Alchemy API URL 
2)The private key of the MetaMask wallet
3)API key of your Pinata account
4)Pinata secret

When you're done, your .env file should look like this:

```bash
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_API_URL="<YOUR_API_URL>"
REACT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY="<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>"
REACT_APP_PINATA_KEY="<YOUR_PINATA_KEY>"
REACT_APP_PINATA_SECRET="<YOUR_PINATA_SECRET>"
```

On running npm start,the app should be available at [Localhost](http://localhost:3000/)

Note: I have used Cloudfare Ipfs to upload the images and metadata to IPFS. (It has been configured in utils.js file) . If cloudfare service is down, then the images for the NFTs might not load properly.
To check if the cloudfare ipfs service is available, please use this link- [Public gateway checker](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/)

## Guide to use the application:
1)Once the app loads, connect your metamask wallet by clicking "Connect Wallet" button. Make sure you have sufficient ETH in your wallet. Also, ensure you are on the Sepolia test network.

2)Go to List My NFT tab and add your NFT to the marketplace by filling in the form.

3)Once your NFT is successfully listed on the marketplace, you can view the NFT on the Marketplace tab.

4)Click on any of the NFT images to view the NFT detail page. Now switch to a different account on your wallet to test the Buy NFT functionality. You can buy NFT using either ETH/ERC20 tokens by choosing the appropriate option from the dropdown and clicking on the buy button.
